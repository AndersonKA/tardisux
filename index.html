      <h1>A Mobile App for The Doctor's Detectives</h1>
      <h2>Introduction and Explanation</h2>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>I'm learning about UX design and wanted to do a project that would allow me to go through the steps of
          brainstorming and creating something new. I watch the show Doctor Who* (if you're not familiar it's nerdy and
          about space and aliens and stuff!), so I decided to work on a project based on the show.</p>

        <p>I’m treating this as a real situation, and since I wasn’t able to speak with actual users I referenced the
          show and the characters to determine what would be most useful.</p>

      </div>
      <!--end of intro-->

      <h2>Issue</h2>
      <div class="issue">
        <p>There has been an increasing amount of alien activity on Earth (mostly focused in London), and the Doctor travels
        all over the Universe. He needs a simple way for Earthlings to report alien activity so he can keep track of what
      happens on Earth even when he isn't here.</p>
      </div>

    <h2>Using a Mobile App</h2>
      <div class="app">
        <p>After listening to potential users I determined a mobile app would be the best way to submit reports. An app will
          allow users to report alien activity right after they've witnessed it, which could possibly allow for
          less biased reports. And the reports don't need to be large or long, so typing on an app shouldn't be too
          frustrating. </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Users</h2>
      <div class="users">
        <p></p>
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>Martha - Martha is 38 and married. She's a physician who used to travel with the Doctor. She currently works
          for UNIT (United Nations Intelligence Taskforce), which is an organization created to protect Earth from alien
          threats. She wants a place where she can view reports and get information about potential alien sightings.</p>
        <p>Sally - Sally is 32 and in a relationship. She co-owns a store in London with her boyfriend and has had
          previous encounters with the Doctor and aliens. She would like a way to communicate with the Doctor if she has
          other encounters with alien life forms in the future. She's also a photographer, so she'd like a way to include
          photos with her submissions.
        <p>Elton - Elton is 40 years old, in a "complicated" relationship, and is a member of a group called
          LINDA (London Investigation 'n' Detective Agency). The members of LINDA have all heard of
        the Doctor and are actively on the lookout for alien activity. He wants a place to record alien activity, keep
        track of reports he's made, and read reports of sightings from other people.</p>

      </div>
      <!--end of users-->


      <h2>Findings</h2>
      <div class="findings">
        <p>After learning what the potential users wanted in an app there were three main categories that would be the
          most useful:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>a way to report alien activity</li>
          <li>a way to read other people's reports</li>
          <li>a way to keep track of previous submissions</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These cover all of the bases without being overwhelming to a user, and leaves room for upgrades in the future
        if users think the app is missing important features.</p>
      </div>
      <!--end of findings-->

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <div class="wireframes">
        <p>I used Sketch to make the wireframes for the app. When speaking with users they seemed to associate the
          color blue with the Doctor (the Doctor's appearance changes but the TARDIS stays the same), so various shades
          of blue are used in the app. I went with a simple layout and large buttons - Sally and Martha
          said the app needed to be straightforward so a person who was in shock after an encounter would still be able
          to use it. The size will also make the app easier to use for people who aren't tech savvy and haven't used many
          apps before.</p>
